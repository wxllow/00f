# 00f - Bring back the oof sound

00f is a script to bring back the oof sound to Roblox without you having to manually mess with game files every time the game updates. Now you just need to run a simple script.

## Run

### Windows (or [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/))

Enter the following in Powershell

```powershell
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://00fps.bagels.sh/'))
```

### macOS

Enter the following into your terminal

```sh
sh <(curl -L https://00f.bagels.sh)
```

## Dependencies

- [mpv](https://mpv.io/) (optional, just plays oof sound after script runs)
